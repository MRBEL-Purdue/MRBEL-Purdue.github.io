Joseph V. Rispoli graduated from <a href="https://www.punahou.edu/?_ga=2.179692644.1546710417.1668831884-851298050.1661199913">Punahou School</a> in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1998, earned the BS degree in Electrical Engineering, BS degree in Computer Engineering, and Minor in Chinese History from the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a> in 2002, and earned the PhD degree in Biomedical Engineering from <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/?_ga=2.184936553.1546710417.1668831884-851298050.1661199913">Texas A&M University</a> in 2015. During the nine-year interim between degrees, he was a development engineer with <a href="https://www.dell.com/">Dell</a> in Austin, Texas, where he worked on high-speed digital design and virtualization technology for multiprocessor servers. He joined Purdue in 2015 as an Assistant Professor, and he was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 2022. 
 
Dr. Rispoliâ€™s research focuses on novel hardware and methodology for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). He is particularly interested in anatomically-tailored radiofrequency coil design for high-field studies, methodolgy for parallel-transmit MRI, in vivo spectroscopy of multiple NMR-active nuclei, and electromagnetic modeling for patient safety and design evaluation.
 
Dr. Rispoli taught the core biomedical engineering undergraduate course BME 305 Bioinstrumentation Circuit and Measurement Principles. He also developed and teaches the graduate-level course BME 555 / ECE 595 Magnetic Resonance Imaging Theory.
